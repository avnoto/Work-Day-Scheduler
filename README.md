## Installation

The site is published at https://avnoto.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

## Usage

This is a daily work scheduler that can save, and clear the user's appointements, as well as mark their items as complete in a "Completed" Section. In addition, the user can save notes in a separate section. The application updates the current day and time.

The schedule outlines a typical work day, with an extra hour before the work day starts, and an extra hour after (8am - 6pm) to adhere to more users' schedules. 

To save an item in a specific time slot, simply click the "Save" icon. 
To clear an item in a specific time slot, simply click the "Clear" icon.
Any item that is saved and marked complete when clicking the "Checked" icon will move to the Completed section.
