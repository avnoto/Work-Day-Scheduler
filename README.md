## Usage

This is a daily work scheduler that can save and clear the user's appointments. In addition, the user can save notes in a separate section. The application updates the current day and time.

The schedule outlines a typical work day, with an extra hour before the work day starts, and an extra hour after (8am - 6pm) to adhere to more users' schedules. 

To save an item in a specific time slot, simply click the "Save" icon.
<br>
To clear an item in a specific time slot, simply click the "Clear" icon.
<br>
To save a note, click anywhere outside the note text area. The note section can be expanded if need be. To clear a note, remove the content inside the text area, then click outside anywhere outside the text area. This works just like the Windows application "Sticky Notes." 

Hour blocks are color coated. Hour blocks that have passed turn gray. The present hour block is pink, and future hour blocks are light blue.
